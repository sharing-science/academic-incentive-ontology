<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>In fields such as medical research, data collection is slow and rigorous, meaning conclusive findings take years to produce. Due to the closed nature of biomedical research, this leads to the reproduction of similar datasets, while leaving datasets with multiple implications abeyant. Further, there is a lack of complete and useful open datasets in many different fields, which leave researchers with no choice but to collect data on their own. There is a rising need for a secure data sharing ecosystem which recommends, incentivizes, and rewards collaborative efforts between researchers and research groups. Permissionless, public blockchains provide the necessary framework for trustless and fair data sharing. We design an ontology to capture the events associated with blockchain-based data sharing and a corresponding incentive scheme, which includes a reputation-based peer review system and an index to provide recommendations and ratings of possible collaborators. We present a use case indicating the ontologyâ€™s plausibility in the biomedical research community and evaluate our ontology with a set of competency questions geared towards participating researchers and other academic stakeholders. Through the use of the ontology, a blockchain ecosystem can be built that will incentivize, encourage, and reward data sharing.</p>
